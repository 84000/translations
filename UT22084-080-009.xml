                <p>The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title>, named after its principal
                    deity Mahāmāyā, is a tantra of the Yoginītantra class in which Mahāmāyā presides over
                    a maṇḍala populated primarily by yoginīs and ḍākinīs. The practitioner
                    engages the antinomian power of these beings through a threefold system of yoga
                    involving the visualization of the maṇḍala deities, the recitation of their
                    mantras, and the direct experience of absolute reality. As well as practices
                    involving the manipulation of the body’s subtle energies, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> incorporates the transgressive
                    practices that are the hallmark of the earlier tantric systems such as the
                        <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhyasamājatantra</title>, specifically the
                    ingestion of sexual fluids and other polluting substances. The tantra promises
                    the grace of Mahāmāyā in the form of mundane and transcendent spiritual
                    attainments to those who approach it with diligence and devotion.</p>

                    <p>The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title>, named after its
                        principal deity Mahāmāyā, belongs to the class of Yoginītantras. According
                        to the post-tenth-century classification scheme of the Tibetan New Schools
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">gsar ma</foreign>), the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> is categorized as a Mother
                        tantra (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ma rgyud</foreign>) among
                        Unexcelled Yoga tantras (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">bla na med pa’i
                            rnal ’byor gyi rgyud</foreign>, <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">
                            yoganiruttaratantra </foreign>). It earns this classification due both
                        to the importance placed on female divinities in the tantra’s maṇḍala and to
                        its inclusion of practices focused on the manipulation of the body’s subtle
                        energies. In this tantra, Mahāmāyā presides over a maṇḍala populated
                        primarily by yoginīs and ḍākinīs, those semi-divine female figures known
                        throughout South Asian tantric traditions for the power they derive from
                        being propitiated with blood, flesh, and sex. The practitioner engages the
                        antinomian power of these beings through a threefold system of yoga
                        involving the visualization of the maṇḍala deities, the recitation of their
                        mantras, and the direct experience of absolute reality. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> also incorporates the
                        transgressive practices that are the hallmark of earlier tantric systems
                        such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhyasamājatantra</title>,<note place="end">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> clearly
                            postdates the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­samāja­tantra</title> because
                            of the instances of intertextuality indicated below in notes 3 and
                            51–55. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­samāja­tantra</title>, and
                            similar works like the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­garbha­tantra</title> demonstrate significant iconographic and
                            ritual innovations over those works typically identified as Yoga‌
                            tantras, such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sarva­tathāgata­tattva­saṃgraha</title>. Beginning in approximately
                            the eighth century CE, the pacific and regal Vairocana was replaced at
                            the center of tantric maṇḍalas by deities associated with the vajra
                            family, frequently in the wrathful form of Akṣobhya known as Heruka.
                            This shift is related to the introduction of transgressive practices and
                            a wrathful, mortuary aesthetic into the established structure of the
                            Yoga‌ tantras, leading some Indian Buddhist commentators to begin to
                            refer to Mahāyoga, or “Great yoga,” tantras. In the later Tibetan
                            doxographical schemes of the New Schools these tantras would be
                            identified as Father tantras (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">pha
                                rgyud</foreign>), joining the yoginītantras in the class of Unexcelled
                            Yoga tantra (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">yoganiruttaratantra</foreign>).
                            The yoginītantras would build upon the framework of these
                            tantras as they introduced their own unique iconographies and practices.</note> 
                        specifically the ingestion of sexual fluids and other polluting
                        substances. The tantra promises the grace of Mahāmāyā in the form of mundane
                        and transcendent spiritual attainments (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">siddhi</foreign>) to those who approach it with
                        diligence, courage, and devotion.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Though it is difficult to pinpoint precisely when the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> first began to circulate within
                        Buddhist tantric communities, the work rose to prominence toward the end of
                        the first millennium CE as part of an efflorescence of new tantric material
                        associated with yoginīs, ḍākinīs, and other female divinities. The
                        designation “yoginītantra” was conferred on these texts precisely because
                        of their incorporation of a more feminized vision of divinity and power.
                        Yoginītantras vary in style and content, ranging from somewhat disordered
                        and obscure works like the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Cakra­saṃvara­tantra</title> to refined and doctrinally coherent texts
                        such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāla­cakra­tantra</title>. With its
                        distinct narrative style, focus on the mundane spiritual attainments, and
                        near total absence of clearly articulated Buddhist doctrine, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> demonstrates a thematic and
                        rhetorical similarity to the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Cakra­saṃvara­tantra</title>, one of the earliest yoginītantras.<note place="end">On the dating of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Cakra­saṃvara­tantra</title>, see Gray (2007) pp 11–14, and Sanderson
                            (2009) pp 158–69.</note> Additionally, considering instances of
                        intertextuality with the earlier <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­samāja­tantra</title>,<note place="end">Verses 3.12–14 of the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­māyā­tantra</title> contain a number of close
                            correspondences with verses 12.52, 53, and 55 of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhya­samāja­tantra</title>
                        </note> and a seeming lack of awareness of more doctrinally and structurally
                        developed yoginītantras such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Hevajra­tantra</title> and <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Kāla­cakra­tantra</title>, it is reasonable to assume that the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­māyā­tantra</title> was among the earlier of the
                        yoginītantras, appearing in Buddhist tantric circles in the late ninth or
                        early tenth centuries. It had certainly gained enough popularity by the
                        eleventh century to draw the attention of the prominent monastic scholars of
                        the period.</p>

                    <p> In India the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­māyā­tantra</title> probably
                        circulated within both the major monastic institutions and the communities
                        surrounding charismatic tantric masters. Foremost among the monastic
                        scholars who commented on the text was Ratnākaraśānti,<note place="end">Regarding Ratnākaraśānti’s dating, see

                    <p> The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> arrived in Tibet in the
                        early eleventh century as part of the second wave of Buddhist teachings to
                        reach the Land of Snows. It appears to have entered Tibet via two distinct
                        lines of transmission, through Marpa Chökyi Lodrö and Gö Lhetsé. The

                        is his lineage, as passed through his disciple Ngoktön Chöku Dorjé (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">rngog ston chos sku rdo rje</foreign>, 1036–1102),
                        that continues to be transmitted to this day. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> also received a great deal of attention from the

                    <p>The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> describes, in verses both
                        terse and enigmatic, the practices and attainments associated with the deity
                        Mahāmāyā and her retinue of yoginīs. Yoginīs, and their close counterparts
                        the ḍākinīs, are renowned for their ability to grant mastery of temporal and
                        transcendent spiritual attainments to devoted and courageous practitioners
                        who are willing to brave an encounter with these often ferocious beings. In
                        this tantra Mahāmāyā is invoked as the queen of ḍākinīs, the queen of the
                        yoginīs, and the supreme secret of these secret goddesses, making her the
                        paramount source of spiritual attainment. The tantra promises the
                        accomplishment of such powers through the visualization of its deities and
                        their maṇḍalas, the manipulation of the body’s subtle energies and the
                        cultivation of the power of transgression through the ingestion of impure
                        substances. And yet these practices are only hinted at within the tantra
                        itself; the specifics are reserved for initiates and are to be spoken only
                        by a lineage holder. Thus, as is the case with most tantras, this text is
                        meant to be practiced only after receiving initiation and instruction from a
                        qualified master.</p>

                    <p>The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title>’s three chapters and
                        eighty-one verses depart from the traditional narrative structure of
                        Buddhist scripture. Buddhist tantras typically follow the sūtra tradition by
                        beginning with a formulaic introduction meant to establish the time, place,
                        audience, and above all the authority of a given scripture. This formula,
                        which begins “Thus I have heard...” (<foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">evaṃ mayā śrutaṃ</foreign>), is absent in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title>, which begins instead with a perfunctory
                        “Now...” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">ataḥ</foreign>).<note place="end">The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Cakrasaṃvaratantra</title> shares this abrupt beginning. For an
                            in-depth discussion of the implications of this style of introduction,
                            see Gray (2007) pp 28–35.</note> This deviation is in part explained
                        by the fact that this is not a discourse of the Buddha, but rather a
                        dialogue between two deities associated with the tantra. However, the lack
                        of a formal introduction leaves it unclear precisely who these deities are.
                        The interlocutor appears to be none other than Mahāmāyā herself; verse 1.25
                        invokes her by name as the recipient of the tantra’s instruction. The
                        speaker, however, is never explicitly identified within the text. Kṛṣṇavajra
                        ventures a guess, suggesting Vajraḍākinī as the source of the teaching.<note place="end">S,  F.108b, lines 6–7. His attribution is somewhat
                            problematic as he contradicts the tantra by stating that the recipient of the
                            discourse is Buddhaḍākinī, not Mahāmāyā.</note> Ratnākaraśānti takes
                        a different approach and, instead of concerning himself with identifying
                        figures not explicitly named in the text, considers the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> to be derived from a much
                        larger mythical compendium of tantras (which he refrains from
                            identifying).<note place="end">G, pp 2–4. </note> It is in that
                        collection, he declares, that one may find the traditional introduction that
                        establishes the important details of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title>’s setting.</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>From this abrupt beginning, the first chapter continues with several verses
                        invoking Mahāmāyā’s qualities and describing the powers acquired through her
                        successful propitiation. Tantras centered upon yoginīs and ḍākinīs, whether
                        Buddhist or non-Buddhist, typically emphasize the attainment of mundane
                        powers over the transcendent; in this the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title> is no different. The yogī who masters the
                        practices of Mahāmāyā will, the text promises, be able to magically influence
                        and attack others, acquire whatever he desires, fly through the sky, travel
                        through other realms, become invisible, possess the bodies of others, and
                        become immortal. Compared to this comprehensive and repetitive list of
                        mundane attainments, the tantra makes only passing reference to the more
                        altruistic and transcendent attainments. Only once does the text mention that
                        its attainments can be used to benefit others (1.28), and only once does
                        it explicitly announce that its practice can result in buddhahood (3.25).</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Following this exhaustive account of the attainments, the first chapter
                        closes with a description of a short sequence of visualization. The reader
                        may be puzzled at this point to find that Mahāmāyā, who had, up to this
                        point, been invoked using explicitly feminine epithets, is suddenly referred
                        to using undeniably masculine terms. Though some suggest this is the tantra
                        of a male deity with a feminine name,<note place="end">English (2002) p
                            47.</note> Mahāmāyā <emph>is</emph> a female deity, as the verses of
                        invocation make clear—she is the great Queen Mahāmāyā, the mother of the
                        guhyakas, and the queen of yoginīs. She is consistently addressed using a
                        specifically feminine epithet, vidyā, that simultaneously invokes her status
                        as the embodiment of knowledge and as the female deity presiding over a
                        maṇḍala. And yet here, and in the third chapter where her iconography is
                        fully described, she becomes the male Heruka, the Virile One (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vīra</foreign>) embracing the consort
                        Buddhaḍākinī. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>This gender ambiguity is clarified when we consider that the tantra describes
                        Mahāmāyā as a feminized form of absolute reality. She is said to pervade
                        everything in the three worlds, to be the source of all the gods, and to
                        create, sustain, and destroy the universe. Most importantly, she is exactly
                        what her name suggests, the “great illusion” that constitutes apparent
                        reality. When she takes embodiment, she can do so in any form necessary,
                        which in the context of this tantra is Heruka, the male deity most
                        frequently found at the center of tantric maṇḍalas. Ratnākaraśānti makes
                        explicit the ontological primacy of the feminine Mahāmāyā; in his commentary
                        he equates her with Vajradhara, the embodiment of absolute reality, who is
                        typically male, and identifies her as “she who has the form of Heruka.”<note place="end">G, p 6: <foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">saiṣeti

                            identifies Mahāmāyā as the fundamental identity of both the male Heruka
                            and his consort, Buddhaḍākinī. He writes, “The lord of the maṇḍala is
                            the glorious Heruka, who is Mahāmāyā; the vidyā Buddhaḍākinī is also
                            Mahāmāyā because they both possess a singular intrinsic nature” (<foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">maṇḍalādhipatiḥ śrīheruko mahāmāyā,

                    <p>The second chapter is the tantra’s shortest and most challenging. Its verses
                        only hint at the techniques and visualizations to which they refer. The
                        communities in which the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyātantra</title>
                        circulated would have guarded their teachings and techniques closely, making
                        complete explanations accessible only to an intimate circle of initiates.
                        The tantra’s verses—especially those that appear to refer to specific
                        techniques—are not meant to be edifying, only allusive. It is the role of
                        the tantric master to unpack each verse and convey its practical content to
                        those prepared to receive it. Thus in this chapter we are offered only the
                        barest of introductions to what was likely a complex sequence of
                        techniques.</p>

                    <p>The fifth verse of the second chapter introduces the primary structure of the
                        tantra’s practices, one the later Tibetan commentators would identify as a
                        framework for the development stage and completion stage practices unique to the
                        <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahā­māyā­tantra</title>.<note place="end">See
                            particularly Jamgön Kongtrul (2008) pp 69–70 and 183–86. He
                            writes: “The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mahāmāyā</title> and other
                            tantras set forth the threefold [formulation consisting of] appearance,
                            mantra and reality [yogas]. These three apply to both path and result;
                            and within the path itself, to both the creation phase and completion
                            phase.” (We have emended “shape” to “appearance” to conform with the
                            terminology used in this translation.) Though the concepts of the development and
                            completion stages were present in the Indian Buddhist tantric
                            tradition, they never reached the degree of uniformity there that they
                            did in the Tibetan tradition. The terms appear nowhere in the

                        complete presentation of the iconography of Mahāmāyā and her retinue. The
                        cultivation of the power of transgression through deliberate consumption of
                        impure, polluting substances is an important aspect of Buddhist tantra.
                        Notions of purity and pollution have been formative elements of South Asian
                        identity since Vedic times. Such an identity is destabilized through contact
                        with and ingestion of impure substances and bodily fluids. Indian Buddhist
                        tantras, especially those of the later Yoga‌ tantra class such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhyasamājatantra</title>,<note place="end">On the
                            ingestion of sexual fluids in these tantras, see Dalton (2004)
                            pp 14–17.</note> positioned the consumption of sexual fluids at the
                        climax of the ritual process so as to harness the force of the transgressive
                        act into a powerful soteriological moment. The same holds true for the
                        ingestion of illicit meats: their ritual consumption negated a social
                        identity formed through the observation of dietary and behavioral
                        proscriptions. Through the eating of taboo substances, practitioners’ bonds
                        with mundane society are fully severed and their acceptance into the
                        community of spiritual adepts is confirmed.</p>

                            Mahā­māyā­tantra</foreign>, the consumption of sexual fluids is presented
                        at the end of the second chapter and the ingestion of illicit meats in the
                        early verses of the third. The final two verses of the second chapter
                        describe, in a typically occluded fashion, the ingestion of sexual fluids
                        that marks the culmination of the meditation sequence. The verses instruct
                        the yogī to keep his mind free of concepts and take the “wish-granting
                        jewel” between his thumb and ring finger and place it in his mouth.
                        Kṛṣṇavajra explains that this refers to the ingestion of “relative <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">bodhicitta</foreign>” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">kun rdzob kyi byang chub sems</foreign>,
                        i.e. semen) after its prolonged retention in the tip of the penis.<note place="end">S, F.213a.</note> In the parlance of the later tradition,
                        this marks the completion stage section of the practice. In the words of the
                        tantra itself, the ingestion of sexual fluids triggers “everlasting
                        spiritual attainment.”</p>

                    <p>Moving into the third chapter, the tantra introduces a sequence of verses
                        outlining the rites associated with the ingestion of sacramental substances. The
                        yogī is instructed to gather the five illicit meats (elephant, horse, cow,
                        dog, and human), roll them individually into pellets, and store them for
                        seven days. Next they are mixed together and stored in the cavity of a
                        rotting jackal for an additional seven days. Finally they are taken out and
                        consumed, resulting in an experience of “the great fruitions” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mahāphalāni</foreign>, 3.6), which
                        Ratnākaraśānti identifies as “the state of wisdom.”<note place="end">G, p

                        common enough in tantric literature, the especially polluting addition of a
                        jackal corpse appears to be a unique contribution of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn"> Mahā­māyā­tantra</title>. We can understand this
                        distinctly unpalatable process as intended to collapse the binaries of pure
                        and impure, precipitating a more complete rejection of dualistic concepts
                        and, as verse 3.1 states, leading to “omniscience.”</p>

                    <p>The final section of the tantra concerns the method of practice, the sādhana, for the deity,
                        including the details of the visualization of Mahāmāyā and her maṇḍala. The
                        stages by which a tantra is to be practiced are frequently concealed within
                        the text—the order will be scrambled and the details elided.<note place="end">We thank Jacob Dalton for bringing this technique of
                            concealment to our attention.</note> The act of organizing these elements
                        is left to tantric teachers and lineage masters, who composed independent
                        ancillary texts to codify the proper sequence of practice. These texts
                        incorporated practices drawn from the oral tradition and embedded the basic
                        outline provided by the tantra within an established sādhana framework that
                        normally included common Buddhist elements such as refuge in the Three
                        Jewels, the generation of the aspiration for awakening, the offering of
                        confession, and so forth. Thus while the core material for a sādhana is
                        found within the tantra itself, each sādhana is unique, reflecting styles
                        and interpretations that are as diverse as their authors. Sādhanas composed
                        on the <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn"> Mahāmāyātantra</foreign> by the Indian
                        authors Ratnākaraśānti, Kukkuripa, Ratnavajra, and Kumé Dorjé (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">sku med rdo rje</foreign>), as well as a

                        3.7 announces the commencement of the sādhana, the majority of practices
                        have already been introduced in the preceding two chapters. But it is only
                        here, at the end of the tantra, that we are finally given the complete
                        iconographic description required for the self-visualization of the deity
                        that precedes all other practices.<note place="end">The description that

                        visualization begins by imagining a red lotus flower with four petals, in
                        the middle of which sits a single subtle sphere. From this sphere, four
                        additional subtle spheres emerge and come to rest on each of the four
                        petals. These four spheres then transform into four yoginīs, each distinct
                        in color and wielding the specific implements described in the tantra. They

                        the central subtle sphere, summoning Mahāmāyā and consort from their

                        iconographic detail. Mahāmāyā takes the dark blue form of Heruka embracing
                        the red Buddhaḍākinī. (S)he has four faces—blue in the east, yellow in the
                        south, red in the west, and blue-green in the north. (S)he has four hands,
                        each holding a different implement: a skull cup, a khaṭvāṅga, a bow, and an
                        arrow.</p>

                    <p>Once this five-deity maṇḍala has been fully imagined, the practitioner is
                        prepared to apply any of the diverse practices that have been described
                        throughout the work: the visualization of mantra syllables and additional

                        sexual fluids and illicit meats. Through identification with Mahāmāyā and
                        engagement in these potent practices, the diligent practitioner will be
                        rewarded with mundane powers, reach “highest attainment of suchness” (3.25), and, as we are told in the tantra’s final verse, be forever protected

                    <p>This translation is based upon a comparative edition, made by the translators,
                        of the Tibetan recensions of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">
                            Mahā­māyā­tantra</title> drawn from the Degé (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sde

                            pho brang</title>) editions of the Tibetan Kangyur. Though the tantra
                        itself no longer exists in Sanskrit, Ratnākaraśānti’s important commentary,
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guṇavatīṭīkā</title>, is preserved in two
                        Sanskrit manuscripts held in Nepal’s Royal Archive, which have been edited
                        by the Central Institute of Higher Tibetan Studies. Because the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guṇavatīṭīkā</title> attests to the majority of the
                        Sanskrit terms, it allows access to much of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">
                            Mahāmāyātantra</title> in its original language. We have therefore given
                        careful consideration to both the Sanskrit edition of this commentary and
                        the manuscripts upon which it is based. Where the Sanskrit term is
                        available, we have privileged the semantic range of the Sanskrit over that
                        of the Tibetan, allowing us to recapture something of the flavor of the
                        original Sanskrit. The commentaries of Ratnākaraśānti and Kṛṣṇavajra were
                        consulted throughout the translation process and greatly influenced our
                        reading of the root text.</p>

                        It is thematically inconsistent and disjunctive in places, and at times the
                        referent of a given verse is unclear. Though this is certainly due in part
                        to attempts by its authors to conceal the meaning or proper sequence of the
                        tantra, it is clear that a grammatically flawed work is hiding behind the
                        Tibetan translation. This is common among Buddhist tantras, as their authors
                        did not always possess a solid command of the Sanskrit language. Where
                        possible we have clarified the text to make it more readable, but there
                        remain passages that are enigmatic and difficult to follow.</p>

                                    phan pa</foreign>), Ratnākaraśānti reads “practice of supreme

                                similarity of the Sanskrit terms for supreme benefit (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">parama hita</foreign>) and for

                                Tibetan translation is attested in Kṛṣṇavajra’s commentary, it was
                                followed here, though Ratnākaraśānti’s reading seems clearer. Where
                                the Tibetan translation reads <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">sangs rgyas kun gyi rang bzhin ’bab</foreign> (“become the

                                [S, F.206b] which is in agreement with the Sanskrit attested by

                        <l> Vidyā! In the three worlds there is nothing equal to my knowledge.<note place="end">There are a couple of noteworthy variants of this verse
                                found in commentarial works. The version from the Degé edition
                                translated here, which is supported in Kṛṣṇavajra’s commentary,
                                reads: “Vidyā! In the three worlds (Tib: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’jig rten gsum po na</foreign>) there is
                                nothing equal to my knowledge (Tib: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">nga yi rig dang mnyam pa med</foreign>).” The
                                recension of the tantra used by Ratnākaraśānti appears to have, instead,
                                “there is nothing (Skt: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">nāsti</foreign>) like you (Skt: <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">te sadṛśī</foreign>) in the triple worlds

                                [G, p 21]. Taranātha attests to yet another variation. In his

                                the same line as “Vidyā! In the three worlds there is nothing like
