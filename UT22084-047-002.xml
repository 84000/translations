                <p>The main topic of this sūtra is an explanation of how the Buddha and all things
                    share the very same empty nature. Through a set of similes, the sūtra shows how
                    an illusion-like Buddha may dispense appropriate teachings to sentient beings in
                    accordance with their propensities. His activities are effortless since his
                    realization is free from concepts. Thus, the Tathāgata’s non-conceptual
                    awareness results in great compassion beyond any reference point.</p>

                    <p>The Ornament of the Light of Awareness (<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Jñānālokālaṁkāra</title>, hereafter JAA) is of particular significance
                        for its discussion of the nature of a buddha, his appearance to sentient
                        beings, and his beneficial activities. These themes are in turn related to
                        the doctrine of buddha nature (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">tathāgatagarbha</foreign>), important for both general Mahāyāna
                        Buddhism and Secret Mantra. The JAA has even been interpreted as propounding
                        an explicit Vajrayāna perspective of purity, and has been quoted by masters
                        of secret mantra in India, Tibet, and Japan. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Although this sūtra is called “an ornament” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">alaṁkāra</foreign>), it is perhaps rather about an
                        ornament. More literally, <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">alaṁkāra</foreign> means “something that completes,” and according to
                        the conventions of ancient and medieval Indian literature, that is what an
                        ornament should do. Therefore, rather than being a dispensable decoration,
                        the sūtra completes and adorns the light or appearance (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">āloka</foreign>) of a special type of knowledge
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">jñāna</foreign>). This knowledge
                        is a meaningful awareness, not just the awareness of an ordinary object.
                        This awareness can engage with, or descend into (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">avatāra</foreign>), the scope of all buddhas, which is
                        their object or, more precisely, their domain (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">viṣaya</foreign>). If we follow the interpretation of
                        the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnagotravibhāga</title>, the light of
                        awareness is itself the ornament that allows bodhisattvas to descend or
                        enter into the domain of all buddhas.<note place="end">

                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Although texts preserved as sūtra or <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">sūtrānta</foreign> are classified as “Word of the Buddha” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">buddhavacana</foreign>), this does not
                        necessarily mean that the Buddha is the main speaker. For example, the bulk
                        of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prajñāpāramitāhṛdaya</title> (the “<title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Heart Sūtra</title>”) consists of a dialogue between
                        the venerable Śāriputra and the bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara. In the present
                        sūtra, however, Buddha Śākyamuni is not only there to offer a seal of
                        approval but is, in effect, the main speaker. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>The sūtra locates its teaching in Rājgir, on the mountain of Vulture Peak.
                        Although this is also the place where many of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prajñāpāramitā</title> teachings are set, the Buddha is here dwelling
                        in the Womb of the Dharmadhātu Palace. The symbolism is perhaps more attuned
                        to the third turning of the <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dharmacakra</foreign>, taking place in a variety of locations and
                        teaching a wide array of advanced topics. </p>
                    <p>The teaching does not take place within the ordinary appearance of our world
                        sphere. Just before the Buddha sits on his lion throne, the entire
                        environment is transformed into the purest gold and jewels. Such emphasis on
                        the purified appearance of the environment of the sūtra may be significant
                        in the light of its more esoteric interpretations. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>The audience is made up of two kinds of individual: hearers who have already
                        become arhats, and bodhisattvas who are close to buddhahood, i.e., on the
                        tenth or last level (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">bhūmi</foreign>),
                        called “Cloud of Dharma.” The hearers are headed by Ājñātakauṇḍinya; his
                        name means “Kauṇḍinya who understood,” and he is described in other sūtras
                        as the first monk to have been praised by the Buddha for having understood
                        his teaching. The bodhisattvas are headed by Mañjuśrī, the embodiment of
                        wisdom or higher knowledge, who is also the main interlocutor of this sūtra. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>The Buddha signals that an exceptional teaching will take place through a
                            <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prātihārya</foreign>, an
                        extraordinary display of light meant to attract audiences from very far
                        away. <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Prātihārya</foreign> is
                        sometimes translated as “miracle,” but rather than being an inexplicable
                        testimony of divine intervention, <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prātihāryas</foreign> are classified in Mahāyāna scholasticism as a
                        means to draw the listeners’ attention, and to instill reverence toward what
                        is going to be taught. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>If we follow Buddhist cosmology and cosmogony, the appearance of a buddha may
                        be understood as an exceptional event, resulting from myriads of positive
                        causal concomitances. Each buddha conforms to specific cosmic regularities,
                        due to inner causal factors (his aspirations during countless previous
                        lives) and outer ones (the collective merit of sentient beings); and each
                        buddha arises within a specific area of the universe, called a “buddhafield”
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">buddhakṣetra</foreign>). This
                        will be the field of activity of one, and only one, buddha—at least in the
                        sense that only one buddha will enact the specific set of activities that,
                        just as the sun cannot avoid shining, no buddha can avoid performing.
                        Certain teachings will be taught by all the buddhas; the jeweled throne that
                        appears and invites Buddha Śākyamuni to sit and teach suggests that this is,
                        indeed, one of those recurrent teachings. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Infinite buddhafields may exist at the same time. Mahāyāna sūtras often
                        specify that diligent and wise bodhisattvas can perceive and even visit
                        other buddhafields, paying their respects and obtaining teachings from the
                        buddhas residing there. In this sūtra, after Buddha Śākyamuni emits light
                        that fills the entire trichiliocosm, a very large number of bodhisattvas
                        arrive from other buddhafields—suggesting once more the importance of the
                        teaching about to be given. </p>
                    <p> Mañjuśrī is the bodhisattva associated with wisdom (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prajñā</foreign>).<note place="end">It is by now
                            common to translate <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prajñā</foreign> as “wisdom,” and more precise alternatives (such
                            as “superior cognition”) may appear cumbersome or odd. However, it is
                            useful to keep in mind that <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prajñā</foreign> is also a synonym for <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">abhidharma</foreign> (a higher understanding of
                        the dharmas), <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dharma­pravicaya</foreign> (the grouping or analysis of the
                            dharmas), and of <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vipaśyanā</foreign> (special insight into the nature of things).
                            This also helps explain the sūtra’s interest in discrete
                            classifications, especially in the last sections.</note> The JAA’s
                        thematic focus on wisdom and the <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">prajñāpāramitā</foreign> is quite clear: Mañjuśrī begins by asking the
                        Buddha about the meaning of non-arising and non-cessation. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>As the <title xml:lang="eng">Heart Sūtra</title> puts it, all dharmas are
                        “emptiness, without characteristics, non-arisen, non-ceased.”<note place="end">[...] <foreign type="quote" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">śūnyatālakṣaṇā
                                anutpannā aniruddhā</foreign> [...] See Vaidya (1961): 98. Note also
                            that “non-cessation, non-arising” are the first words of Nāgārjuna’s
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Mūla­madhyamaka­kārikā</title>; the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Jñānālokālaṁkāra</title> is quoted in
                            Candrakīrti’s commentary to the “Examination of the Tathāgata” section,
                            where emptiness (hence, non-arising and non-cessation) is the logical
                            ground to prove the fundamental equality between the Tathāgata and all
                            the dharmas. The same quote appears in Kamalaśīla’s commentary to the
                            <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vajra­cchedikā</title>, and in Rongzom
                            Mahāpaṇḍita’s explanation of <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">dharmatā­yukti</foreign> (reasoning in terms of the nature of the
                            dharmas). See Köppl (2008): 117.</note> That all dharmas neither arise

                        non-Mahāyāna counterparts. While all Buddhist schools agree that dharmas are
                        dependently arisen, within a Mahāyāna perspective this also entails that in
                        some sense they do not arise and do not cease (in the Yogācāra scheme of

                            epithets of the Tathāgata, it shows that the Buddha is

                        <item>ii. The nine examples explain what it means for the Tathāgata to be
                            non-arising and non-cessation (given in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnagotravibhāga</title> as the reason for his being
                            unproduced).</item>
                        <item> iii. The explanations of all that has been pacified show that, since
                            all his elaborations and concepts have been pacified, the Tathāgata is
                                <emph>effortless</emph> with respect to his own activities.</item>
                        <item>iv. The next section shows that the Tathāgata realizes for himself the
                            gates to the realization of the nature of all dharmas, and goes on to
                            explain the sixteen features of the Tathāgata’s realization (this links

                    <p>The activity of a buddha is a complex matter, and it is therefore
                        understandable that the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnagotravibhāga</title>
                        gears its interpretation of the JAA toward the illustrations that help make
                        this difficult point easier to assimilate. Buddhas are free from delusion in
                        the form of conventions, yet appear to engage with conventions in order to
                        benefit others. A buddha is free from mental constructs and intentional
                        mental elaborations, yet his teachings are attuned to each and every
                        mindset. This seeming paradox has been tackled through a number of divergent
                        solutions, some of which (as we shall see) are directly linked to the
                        contents of the JAA. </p>

                    <p>Following the nine analogies, the JAA discusses the nature of awakening. The
                        topic is brought up to explain why a buddha’s activity is as described in
                        the nine analogies. The answer is that a buddha’s activity could not be
                        otherwise because of the nature of a buddha’s awakening. The JAA’s
                        progression follows the questions posed by Mañjuśrī, directly enunciating
                        the first part of the syllogistic structure discussed above (the

                        the perception of objects. Mañjuśrī most consistently praises the Buddha for
                        the lack of that perception. The section on the nature of awakening
                        concludes with several verses extolling Śākyamuni Buddha as “you who are
                        free of any point of reference” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">nirālamba</foreign>). Freedom from point of reference is <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">jñāna</foreign> rather than <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vijñāna</foreign>; it is not mind or

                        Advayavajra (11th century, also known as Maitrīgupta and Maitrīpa) was a
                        student of Naropa, Ratnākaraśānti (10–11th century), Jñānaśrīmitra (10–11th
                        century), and Śabarapāda (10–11th century?). He is also considered one of
                        the two main teachers of Marpa Chökyi Lodrö (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mar pa chos kyi blo gros</foreign>, 1012–1097). The
                        colophons to his works describe Advayavajra as both a great scholar
                            (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">paṇḍita</foreign>) and a

                        double characterization. His Madhyamaka interpretation is especially attuned
                        to Vajrayāna practice and to the context and terminology of <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mahāmudrā</foreign>. In both regards,
                        recurrent notions in the JAA play an important role within his writings, and
                        he cites the JAA in at least three texts.<note place="end">

                    <p>The translation presented here is primarily based on the Sanskrit edition by
                        the Study Group on Buddhist Sanskrit Literature (2005). The Sanskrit was
                        also compared to the Tibetan translation in the Degé Kangyur. In several
                        instances the Tibetan proved useful by offering more complete readings.
                        Hence, we have at times followed the Tibetan rather than the Sanskrit
                        reading. On occasion, we have also consulted Kimura’s transliteration of the
                        Sanskrit manuscript (GRETIL version, 2004) and reverted to its readings. For
                        the most part, the Tibetan follows the Sanskrit closely, although in a few
                        instances it appears to be based on a different manuscript tradition. This
                        is certainly plausible if the proposed date of the Sanskrit manuscript
                        (11th–13th century) is correct, since the Tibetan translation was produced
                        centuries earlier. </p>

                            not see anything whatsoever. In that respect, Mañjuśrī, what is anything
                            whatsoever? It is the mind and the point of reference. When one does not
                            see the mind and the point of reference, one then sees reality. In this
                            way, the Tathāgata has realized, through their very sameness, that all
                            these dharmas are equal. <ref cRef="130"/>

                            collected within a single basis: the peaceful basis. That which is
                            peaceful is very peaceful. That which is very peaceful is utterly
                            peaceful. That which is utterly peaceful is utter pacification; utter
                            pacification is called the sage. Thus, Mañjuśrī, just like space, so is
                            awakening. Just like awakening, so are the dharmas. Just like the
                            dharmas, so are sentient beings. Just like sentient beings, so are the
                            fields. Just like the fields, so is nirvāṇa. Therefore, Mañjuśrī, it is
                            said that all dharmas are the same as nirvāṇa. Since this is their
                            ultimate mode, there is no counteragent. Because there is no
                            counteragent, they are primordially pure, primordially stainless, and
                            primordially without disturbances. It is thus, Mañjuśrī, that the
                            Tathāgata realized all dharmas to be; as he observes the sphere of
                            sentient beings, a pure, great compassion that is free from
                            disturbances, called play, comes about toward those sentient beings.

                            which is understood as destruction is simply the destruction of

                            The destruction of the outflows, Mañjuśrī, is a conventional expression,
