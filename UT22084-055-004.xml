                <p>In this sūtra the Buddha Śākyamuni explains how to attain the absorption known as
                    “the illusory absorption,” a meditative state so powerful that it enables
                    awakening to be attained very quickly. He also teaches that this absorption has
                    been mastered particularly well by two bodhisattvas, Avalokiteśvara and
                    Mahāsthāmprāpta, who live in Sukhāvatī, the distant realm of the Buddha
                    Amitābha. The Buddha Śākyamuni summons these two bodhisattvas to this world and,
                    when they arrive, recounts the story of how they first engendered the mind of
                    awakening. Finally the Buddha reveals the circumstances surrounding the future
                    awakening of Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmprāpta.</p>

                        <title xml:lang="eng">The Illusory Absorption</title> is a sūtra that
                        belongs to the general sūtra section of the Kangyur. In the fashion typical
                        of Great Vehicle sūtras, the Buddha’s discourse unfolds within a worldview
                        vastly different in scope from ordinary reality. Here we meet bodhisattvas
                        who have journeyed across billions of universes to hear the Buddha’s
                        teaching, bringing with them samples of the splendors and pleasures that
                        adorn their distant buddha realms. The vast scope of this sūtra pertains not
                        only to the distances traveled, but also to the timespan covered. Through
                        his omniscience, the Buddha recalls events that happened at the dawn of time
                        and predicts affairs yet to unfold in a far-distant future. In this way our
                        ordinary perceptions of time and space are challenged as we enter the
                        worldview of the Great Vehicle. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>The sūtra begins outside Vārāṇasī, in the Deer Park where the Buddha first
                        turned the wheel of Dharma after his awakening. This time, however, he is
                        not just speaking to his five previous companions, the audience for his
                        first teaching. Now, we are told, there are 20,000 monks, 12,000
                        bodhisattvas, 20,000 deities, and several hundred thousand other beings
                        present. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>As is customary in sūtra literature, the Buddha delivers his Dharma talks at
                        the request of someone who poses a particular question and asks for
                        clarification. In this particular sūtra, the role of the questioner is
                        played by a bodhisattva named Padmaśrīgarbha, who asks the Buddha how one
                        can attain a particular type of absorption known as <distinct>the illusory
                            absorption</distinct> and, after attaining that absorption, quickly
                        attain complete awakening. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>The Buddha is pleased with this request and praises Padmaśrīgarbha for asking
                        such a meaningful question. He then proceeds to explain that there is one
                        quality that underlies all attainments of awakened qualities and the state
                        of awakening itself. When in possession of this one quality, a bodhisattva will
                        naturally proceed along the path until finally gaining perfect buddhahood.
                        The Buddha reveals that this crucial and indispensable quality is not to
                        abide anywhere in the three realms, whether internally in the mental sphere
                        or externally in the outer world. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>If one is able not to abide in this manner, one will come to understand that
                        all phenomena are unborn, an understanding that enables one to practice the
                        bodhisattva path. With the realization that all phenomena are unborn comes
                        the understanding that phenomena are likewise illusory and empty. This is
                        the point at which one attains the illusory absorption. When this absorption
                        is attained, one is able to display a variety of bodies in order to teach
                        and guide sentient beings. At that point, full and complete awakening is not
                        far off. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Padmaśrīgarbha continues to ask the Buddha about the illusory absorption, and
                        he wonders whether anyone among his peers in the Buddha’s retinue might have
                        obtained this absorption. Indeed, the Buddha confirms, several students have
                        gained this absorption, but all of them have attained their realization by
                        associating with two bodhisattvas, Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmprāpta, who
                        live in Sukhāvatī, the distant realm of Buddha Amitābha. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Padmaśrīgarbha implores the Buddha to manifest a miraculous sign that will
                        summon these two bodhisattvas, so that others may be blessed by their
                        presence in this world and likewise attain the illusory absorption. The
                        Buddha consents and emits a light from the hair between his eyebrows, a
                        light so bright that it illuminates the entire world of Sukhāvatī. When all
                        the bodhisattvas in Sukhāvatī ask Amitābha about the origin of this light,
                        he reveals that it is being emitted by Buddha Śākyamuni to indicate that a
                        Dharma teaching will shortly be delivered. Avalokiteśvara and
                        Mahāsthāmprāpta request permission to attend the teaching, and Amitābha
                        encourages them to go. The two bodhisattvas bring with them on the journey
                        no less than 840 million other bodhisattvas, who each manifest a beautiful
                        mansion as an offering to the Buddha Śākyamuni. Avalokiteśvara and
                        Mahāsthāmprāpta multiply this offering by emanating 840 million exact copies
                        within each mansion, thus producing a mind-boggling display of gifts. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>The pilgrimage to this world is not an arduous one by any means, being
                        completed within a single second. Once the bodhisattvas arrive, they pay
                        homage to Buddha Śākyamuni and sing his praises in a series of beautiful
                        verses. The bodhisattvas and hearers in the retinue of Buddha Śākyamuni are,
                        of course, amazed by the arrival of all the bodhisattvas from Sukhāvatī and
                        their impressive display of offerings. So they ask the Buddha about the
                        merit that allows Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmprāpta to perform such a
                        display. The Buddha reveals how these two bodhisattvas are able to multiply
                        their bodies in inconceivable ways, thus gaining merit by serving countless
                        buddhas in endless realms. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Next, Buddha Śākyamuni recounts the story of how Avalokiteśvara and
                        Mahāsthāmprāpta first gave rise to the mind of awakening that signifies the
                        beginning of the bodhisattva path. We hear how these two beings, in a far,
                        far distant past, were born miraculously from two lotus flowers in the realm
                        of a buddha known as King of the Golden-Hued Lion’s Play, who himself was a
                        previous emanation of Buddha Amitābha. The place where it all unfolded, we
                        are told, was none other than the world of Sukhāvatī, at that time known as
                        Boundless Accumulation of Precious Qualities and Full Display of Happiness. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>As is typical of many Great Vehicle sūtras, the Buddha proceeds to reveal the
                        circumstances surrounding the future awakening of the protagonists in
                        question, in this case Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmprāpta. Once Buddha
                        Amitābha has passed into nirvāṇa and no trace remains of his teachings,
                        Avalokiteśvara will fully awaken at dawn on the very next day and receive
                        the name Buddha Samanta­raśmyabhyudgata­śrī­kūta­rāja. At that point the
                        realm will no longer be known as Sukhāvatī, but rather Complete Gathering of
                        Wealth. Next, once this particular buddha passes into nirvāṇa,
                        Mahāsthāmprāpta will awaken in a similar fashion and be known as 
                        Supra­tiṣṭhita­guṇa­maṇi­kūṭa­rāja. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>The names of these two future buddhas turn out to be of key importance in the
                        sūtra, because anyone who happens to hear them will be irreversibly destined
                        to unsurpassed and perfect awakening. The blessing of hearing these two
                        names is also such that any woman will be able to put an end to future
                        female rebirths, and in that way join the saṅgha of monks. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>At this point the Buddha’s teaching is complete, and everyone in attendance
                        rejoices and arouses the mind set upon unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
                        Many of the listeners in attendance develop various signs of accomplishment
                        and become free from obscurations. Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmprāpta also
                        cause a miracle so that the entire retinue can behold all the limitless,
                        uncountable buddhas in all directions, who are making prophecies for their
                        unsurpassed and perfect awakening. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>As is typical of Great Vehicle sūtras, toward the end of the story the Buddha
                        speaks of the great amount of merit to be gained by upholding and
                        propagating the sūtra, and everyone gathered at the occasion promises to
                        spread the teaching to the best of their ability. The Buddha repeats his
                        statement that any woman who hears this teaching will be transformed
                        immediately into a man. (Today’s readers should keep in mind that these
                        teachings were given in a society where the status of women was generally
                        low, and women were expected to be subservient and deferential to men. It is
                        also important to remember that the Buddha did allow women into his order,
                        which at the time was a radical endorsement of women as worthy spiritual
                        practitioners.) </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Finally, while thousands of gods scatter flowers and praise on the Buddha and
                        the assembled bodhisattvas, a young girl stands up and announces that she
                        has decided to give up the negative emotions that cause beings to be born as
                        women. Instead, she promises, she will set her mind on complete awakening.
                        In front of the Buddha she vows to become an example for other women by
                        relinquishing her female body, and she requests the Buddha’s blessings to
                        help her do so. Immediately her body is transformed and becomes that of a
                        man. With this metamorphosis complete, the Buddha foretells that she is
                        destined to become a future buddha known by the name Repeller of All
                        Disturbing Emotions, and the sūtra comes to an end. </p>
                    <p>No Sanskrit version of the text is known to exist, but in addition to this Tibetan 
                        translation the sūtra survives in two earlier Chinese translations. The Tibetan translation, 
                        by Surendrabodhi and Yeshé Dé, must have been completed in the early translation period, 
                        as it is listed in both early 9th century inventories, the 
                        Denkarma (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan dkar ma</title>) and Phangthangma

                        both the Degé and Narthang Kangyurs, the sūtra has nine chapters or sections 
                        (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">le’u</foreign>), and the Narthang catalogue mentions that the 
                        existence of nine <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">le’u</foreign> is mentioned by the 
                        Great Fifth Dalai Lama in the list of texts of which he received the transmission 
                        (<foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn" type="term">gsan yig</foreign>). However, no such formal section breaks 
                        can be seen in the Tibetan text as preserved in the different Kangyurs. While 
                        it is possible to discern nine or more parts to the narrative, it would be unusual for a 
                        relatively short text such as this to be  divided into formally distinct chapters.</p>
                    <p>Unlike the names of some of the specific absorptions described in sūtras, “the illusory 
                        absorption” is a term that occurs in a wide range of canonical texts, including the 
                        Prajñāpāramitā sūtras, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Laṅkāvatāra</title>, and in several

                        progress to unsurpassed and completely perfect awakening, and grants him the

                        with reality. As he unites with reality, nothing will impede his mind. As

                    <p>“What does it mean to engage in authentic conduct? It is as follows. <ref cRef="F.212.a"/> All phenomena arise in dependence. There is no
                        phenomenon that can remain constantly. All phenomena arise from
                        circumstances. There is no phenomenon that arises without circumstances. Any
                        phenomenon that arises in dependence is unborn. Therefore all phenomena are
                        unborn. To realize that all phenomena are unborn is to know how to practice
                        the bodhisattva’s path. In this way, one attains the basis for benefiting
                        all beings and can proceed with a compassionate outlook. With such
                        conviction, one comes to understand that all phenomena are illusory. All
                        phenomena are magically manifest because they are imputed. Those imputations
                        are also utterly empty. The realization that all phenomena are empty is the

                        passed into nirvāṇa. We rejoice in their names!” And they continued,
                        “Blessed One, this entire gathering now engenders the mind of unsurpassed
                        and perfect awakening.” </p>
                    <p>Then the Blessed One prophesied their unsurpassed and perfect awakening.
                        Eight trillion four hundred thousand million beings purified their eye of
                        Dharma regarding phenomena so that it became stainless and unobscured. Seven

                        extensively and genuinely teaches it to others?” </p>

                        you have put to the Thus-Gone One. Son of noble family, it is because base
                        sentient beings may distrust the Thus-Gone One’s teachings, and will
                        therefore continue to meet with harm, unhelpful situations, unhappiness, and
