                    The tantra covers a range of practices and philosophical perspectives of late

                    with its tribute to and apotheosis of women and, in this regard, probably has
                    few parallels anywhere else in world literature. It is written in the spirit of
                    great sincerity and devotion, and it is this very spirit that mitigates, and at
                    the same time empowers, the text’s stark imagery and sometimes shocking
                    practices. This text certainly calls for an open mind. </p>

                <p>As is the case with all tantras, the person who put the CMT into writing chose to
                    remain anonymous in conformity with the tradition, which no doubt saw the author
                    merely as a medium for conveying this secret teaching. However, in the search
                    for the earthly origin of this text, the circumstantial evidence seems to point
                    to a Nepalese origin, most likely Newar. Of the one hundred–plus extant
                    manuscripts of the CMT, ranging in date from 1380 up to the twentieth century,
                    all were written in Nepal, as were the only two known manuscripts of the CMT
                    commentary, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Padmāvatī</title>. </p>

                <p>Although the tradition of this tantra and its title deity never became widespread
                    or popular outside the Kathmandu Valley, it flowered and thrived for almost a
                    millennium among Kathmandu’s Newar Buddhist community, leaving a rich legacy
                    still evident today. There is at least one active shrine of Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa in
                    the Kathmandu Valley; it is part of the sacred Hiraṇyavarṇa Mahāvihāra complex
                    in Patan. Most shops that sell Buddhist art in Kathmandu offer a selection of
                    Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa paintings, and the CMT is still being taught by Newari
                    Bajracharyas—themselves part of its unbroken spiritual heritage—such as
                    Yagnyaman Pati Bajracharya, who traces his family line back to the
                    eighth-century Buddhist master Vilāsavajra. </p>
                <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                <p>The CMT appears to have drawn on a number of earlier scriptures, including the
                        <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Guhyasamājatantra</title>, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Hevajratantra</title>, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Siddhaikavīratantra</title>, and the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Cittaviśuddhiprakaraṇa</title> of Āryadeva. In turn, it influenced other
                    works, such as the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Vidyādharavinodatantra</title>.<note place="end">Cf. Isaacson (2006).</note> However, among all the works devoted
                    to the deity Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa, the CMT is unquestionably the most important.

                <p>One should note, however, that the CMT was not the first scripture to introduce
                    its main deity. There is at least one earlier occurrence of the name
                    Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa, found in the first chapter of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Siddhaikavīratantra</title> as part of the mantra <foreign type="mantra">oṁ

                    The translation presented here is therefore the first complete translation of
                    this text since the Tibetan appeared. In general, it follows the Sanskrit
                    edition, although it does at times incorporate the Tibetan; such instances are
                    listed in the endnotes. However, as there are literally hundreds of minor
                    differences between the Sanskrit and the Tibetan, not all variations have been

                <p>The translation also attempts to reflect the exegesis found in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Padmāvatī</title>, the only extant commentary on the CMT,
                    which was written by one Mahāsukhavajra. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Padmāvatī</title> is preserved in two Nepali manuscripts, one of which is a
                    direct copy of the other. The older of the two, used for this translation, can
                    be dated to 1297. This commentary has never been edited or translated, except
                    the part corresponding to chapters 9–12 of the CMT, which was edited by Harunaga
                    Isaacson as an accompaniment to his edition of the root text of these four
                    chapters. Professor Isaacson’s edition, along with text-critical and analytical
                    notes, was kindly made available for the present translation. The <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Padmāvatī</title> covers select chapters only, and even
                    then tends to skip lengthy parts of the text. This Sanskrit text, which was
                    never translated into Tibetan, is in many places corrupt and fraught with
                    ambiguities, and the manuscript is unfortunately not always legible.

                <p>The text of the CMT presumes the reader’s prior knowledge and understanding of
                    Buddhism’s main principles, including the tenets of Vajrayāṇa. Further, it
                    requires that the reader has faith and devotion, which is so indispensable for
                    the intuitive grasp of, and the eventual awakening to, the true nature of
                    things—the nature that is described as empty (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">śūnya</foreign>). According to the CMT, this awakening is
                    irreversible and is therefore termed <distinct>indestructible

                    practices found in our text become significant: they are a call to give up our
                    deluded dualistic notions, while at the same time constituting a touchstone for
                    the direct experience of reality, a reality where even that which may seem
                    revolting to the conceptual mind can now be experienced as the deity. The
                    inclusion of such “extreme” practices is a testimony to the fact that the CMT
                    presents us not with mere sophistries, but with practices rooted in actual

                <p>The text clearly states that the master must not give instructions for the
                    “inverted” practices to someone who has not first been initiated into the
                    maṇḍala of Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa. The initiation itself would not be effective unless
                    the pupil has realized the empty nature of mind, and the practices must not be
                    undertaken by someone who has not achieved sufficient control over his
                    prāṇa-mind (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">vāyucitta</foreign>).
                    However, as there are currently no lineage masters who could give the
                    Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa empowerment or even the reading authorization (Tib. <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">lung</foreign>) for the formal Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa
                    sādhanas, or who could give instruction in other Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa practices found
                    in the CMT, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to become initiated into
                    these practices. As for the reading of the CMT, one should perhaps proceed at
                    one’s own risk—with the prerequisite, perhaps, of an open and respectful frame
                    of mind. </p>

                <p>To facilitate the arising of nondual awareness, the tantras, especially those of
                    the Yoginī class, bring in another essential element. This is the overwhelming
                    intensity of experience that obliterates mental acts of self-reference. When
                    this experience is founded on an exclusively benevolent frame of mind, such as
                    the feeling of great affection (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">mahārāga</foreign>), there is a chance that dualistic fixations can melt
                    away, bringing on an irreversible change. This brings us closer to the specific
                    content of the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇatantra</title>, namely
                    its sexual practices. When used skillfully, sexuality becomes a powerful tool.
                    The ritual union engages the two partners on all levels—the physical level; the
                    level of the five senses (the senses constituting a bridge between the body and
                    consciousness); and all the different levels of consciousness. The partners,
                    perceiving each other as deities, generate strong love and devotion for one
                    another. Their union allows for an intense experience, which brings the mind
                    effortlessly into focus and sharpens the awareness. After the intensity peaks,
                    there is a brief natural gap, when the three <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">kleśas</foreign>—desire, aversion, and indifference, which
                    normally drive one’s conceptual thinking—completely cease. All that is needed at
                    this point is recognition. This recognition can be arrived at and stabilized
                    through the repeated practice of ritual union. </p>

                    and certainly not unique to the tantras. In India, the ancient norm-setting law
                    books (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">smṛtiśāstras</foreign>), which
                    remained authoritative throughout the entire Indian phase of Vajrayāṇa Buddhism,
                    were concerned not so much with the youngest age at which sexual activity was
                    permissible, but rather with the oldest <emph>before</emph> which the girl must
                    become sexually active in order not to miss her first opportunity to conceive.
                    One law book warns of consequences if this opportunity is missed: “When she
                    reaches twelve…, the forefathers (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">pitṛ</foreign>) of the girl who has not yet been given in marriage will
                    themselves drink her menstrual discharge every month” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Parāśarasmṛti</foreign>, 7:5–6). Another book concurs: “A
                    girl who sees her own menstrual blood in her father’s house shall be known as an
                    outcaste” (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Viṣṇusmṛti</foreign>, 24:41).
                    The purpose of the sexual act as espoused in different literary genres may have
                    varied (from the reproductive in the <foreign type="term" xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">smṛtiśāstras</foreign> to the soteriological in the Yoga and Yoginī
                    tantras), but the early sexual initiation is evidenced throughout the whole
                    spectrum of Indian literature. This having been said, one must add that the age
                    most often recommended by the tantras was actually not twelve but sixteen; this
                    is paralleled by the age of the deity forms visualized during the sādhana. </p>

                <p>But the sexual practices are not the only content of the CMT, which is varied and
                    rich. This tantra aims to be a guide, complete in itself, which takes care of
                    both our soteriological and mundane needs. Since the CMT includes all the
                    standard elements of a classical Buddhist tantra of the later period, it may be
                    unnecessary to describe, or even list, all these elements here. Instead a brief
                    mention of some of its salient features might be of benefit. (For a full list of

                <p>One such feature is the exalted position of women. This thread, present
                    throughout the text, starts from the premise that the man and the woman are
                    deities—Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa and Vajradhātvīśvarī, respectively—and both should
                    worship each other as such. The text, however, dwells on the service rendered by
                    a man to a woman, rather than the other way around. The woman is the one who
                    grants the ultimate beatitude and the final awakening, and she is the one who
                    deserves infinite gratitude and devout service. This may be best illustrated by

                    plant species contend for the same name. Modern scholars of āyurveda or
                    ethnobotany do not always agree among themselves concerning the correct
                    identification of some plants. A certain amount of care was taken, however, to
                    identify every plant by the names found in the Sanskrit and the Tibetan texts. A
                    number of reference works and specialized websites were consulted, but, needless
                    to say, not all the plants and substances have been identified reliably, and
                    some could not be identified at all. Some passages in the sections containing

                    take the form of a request or a prayer, and their semantic content is usually
                    related to the ritual in which they are employed. This particularly applies to

                            mutual passion, one feels aversion for the father and attraction for the

                            being. One emerges from the womb as a newborn. One kills the father in
                            order to take his place, and seizes the mother because of motherly love
                            received in one’s former births, and also for the sake of exquisite
                            pleasure. One, too, begets sons and daughters, who are, respectively,
                            White Acala, Delusion Vajrī, and so forth. The sons, for their part, are
                            patricides, wholly intent on fornication, and nothing but enemies. One
                            should therefore kill them. As for the daughters, one should make love
                            to them because of motherly love received in one’s former births, and
                            also for the sake of exquisite pleasure. [XV.10] </p>
