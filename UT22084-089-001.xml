                    <title xml:lang="eng">The Tantra of Siddhaikavīra</title> is a tantra of ritual
                    and magic. It is a relatively short text extant in numerous Sanskrit manuscripts
                    and in Tibetan translation. Although its precise date is difficult to establish,
                    it is arguably the first text to introduce into the Buddhist pantheon the deity
                    Siddhaikavīra—a white, two-armed form of Mañjuśrī. The tantra is primarily
                    structured around fifty-five mantras, which are collectively introduced by a
                    statement promising all mundane and supramundane attainments, including the ten
                    bodhisattva levels, to a devotee who employs the Siddhaikavīra and, presumably,
                    other Mañjuśrī mantras. Such a devotee is said to become a wish-fulfilling gem,
                    constantly engaged in benefitting beings. Most of the mantras have their own
                    section that includes a description of the rituals for which the mantra is
                    prescribed and a brief description of their effects. This being a tantra of the
                    Kriyā class, the overwhelming majority of its mantras are meant for use in rites
                    of prosperity and wellbeing. </p>

                    <p>Despite what its title might suggest, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Siddhaikavīratantra</title> (hereafter SEV) is not a tantra of
                        Siddhaikavīra in the same way that, for example, the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Hevajratantra</title> is a tantra of Hevajra.
                        Siddhaikavīra is not the main subject, and indeed, excluding the chapter
                        colophons, his name is mentioned in the tantra only three times—and,
                        interestingly, never in a mantra. Nevertheless, Siddhaikavīra is awarded
                        prominence in the text in a short preamble that introduces the SEV and
                        points out the soteriological nature of the mantra of
                        Siddhaikavīra-Arapacana, the forty-first mantra of the fifty-five in this
                        text and the only one that invokes him, setting this mantra somewhat apart
                        from other mantras, most of which have magical and practical applications.
                        The ritual related to this particular mantra requires the visualization of
                        Siddhaikavīra, but even then he is invoked not by the name Siddhaikavīra but
                        as Arapacana. Only one other mantra, addressed to Arkamālinī
                        (Mahāsarasvatī), involves the visualization of Siddhaikavīra. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p> The deity that can be distilled from the SEV is in essence Mañjuśrī; he is
                        addressed in the traditional homage at the beginning of the tantra under his
                        name of Mañjughoṣa; it is he, under his name Mañjuvajra, who delivers the
                        SEV at the bodhisattva Vajradhara’s request; and Siddhaikavīra, likewise, is
                        none other than Mañjuśrī. In the paragraph following the forty-first mantra,
                        Siddhaikavīra is equated with both Arapacana and Mañjuvajra. Thus, the
                        distribution and juxtaposition of these names throughout the text implies
                        that all these deities are one and the same: Mañjuśrī. One of the
                        lesser-known forms of Mañjuśrī, Siddhaikavīra is also the subject of four
                        sādhanas in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Sādhanamālā</title> (Bhattacharyya
                        1968) where some of his descriptions correspond in detail to the
                        visualizations given in the SEV—he is a white figure with a blue lotus in
                        his left hand and displaying a boon-granting gesture with his right. In two
                        of these sādhanas he is called Siddhaikavīramañjughoṣa, confirming that he
                        is identical to the deity mentioned in the homage at the beginning of the
                        SEV, Mañjughoṣa. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p> Being a collection of mantras and their rituals, the SEV introduces the
                        reader to the enchanted world of magical powers that can affect the daily
                        reality of people’s lives and, ultimately, deliver them from the miseries of
                        cyclic existence. Since, however, the SEV is a Kriyā tantra, it is the
                        mantras of magic that predominate in this text. These mantras testify to the
                        richness and versatility of the Buddhist pantheon in this formative period
                        of the Buddhist tantra. The deities being invoked are given a range of
                        evocative names and epithets—the glossary of the names found in this tantra
                        contains more than 100 entries. The appearance in this text of some deities,
                        including Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa and Kurukullā,<note place="end">For more on these two deities, see Dharmachakra (2016) and (2011), respectively.</note> could be the first anywhere in
                        literary sources, making the SEV a historically important text. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p> The date of the SEV is very uncertain. As a Kriyā tantra, it could date from
                        as early as the beginning of the Common Era. At the opposite end, its
                        terminus ante quem is set by the date of the Tibetan translation by the
                        great paṇḍit Atīśa (980–1054). It might be not unreasonable to guess,
                        however, that the SEV dates to somewhere between the 7th and the 9th
                        centuries. This tantra is extant in both Sanskrit and in Tibetan. The
                        Sanskrit text has been preserved in many manuscripts held in the National
                        Archives in Kathmandu as well as in several libraries around the world; it
                        has also been edited and published twice, by Janardan Pandey (1998) and then
                        by Nobuo Otsuka (1995). The Tibetan canonical translation found in the Kangyur 
                        (Toh 544) is attributed to Dīpaṃkara Śrījñāna (Atīśa) and Géwai Lodrö. It
                        is also included, together with a commentary by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo
                        (1820–1892), in the 19th century collection of practice 
                        materials, the <foreign xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">Druptap Küntü</foreign>

                        century indicates that the SEV, despite being a Kriyā tantra, never lost its
                        popularity over time. </p>

                    <p>The SEV is divided into four chapters of decreasing length. Chapter 1, the
                        longest, contains a mixture of mantras with a variety of applications. They
                        are grouped by their applications and include mantras for controlling
                        weather, warding off enemies, averting disasters, removing fear, pacifying
                        disputes, stopping fires, preventing epidemics, curing diseases, safely
                        delivering a child, releasing one from imprisonment, obtaining long life,
                        and curing leprosy, as well as more general applications for protecting
                        humans and animals from all kinds of trouble, destroying evil, and
                        fulfilling one’s wishes. The deities invoked in this chapter range in their
                        origin from flesh-eating demons, or piśācas, such as Parṇaśabarī, to
                        sambhogakāya deities such as Caṇḍamahāroṣaṇa. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Chapter 2 contains two groups of mantras. The first group concerns divination
                        and soothsaying. At the beginning, the qualities of a person to whom the
                        contents of this chapter can be revealed are described and, pertinently, the
                        value and sacredness of truth is stressed. As we read in the invocation to
                        Vimalacandra, one of the gods of divination (2.2-3): </p>

                    <p>In the original Sanskrit we have a play on words, as the word used for
                        “mirror,” <foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">darpaṇa</foreign>, can also be another
                        name for the mountain of Kubera, itself associated with divination. The
                        rites and methods described aim at ascertaining facts that are normally
                        outside one’s sphere of perception, like possible good or bad outcomes of a
                        particular undertaking, or even the time of someone’s death. The requested
                        knowledge can be revealed in a mirror, in one’s sleep, or in some other way.
                        The deities invoked in divination mantras range from piśācas, such as
                        Karṇapiśācī, to sambhogakāya deities such as Mañjuśrī. The name
                        “Karṇapiśācī” suggests a piśācī who whispers into one’s ear (<foreign xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">karṇa</foreign>), and as may be expected, her mantra
                        requests her to whisper her answers into one’s ear. Other divination deities
                        can have equally suggestive names or epithets, such as Siddhalocanā
                        (Accomplished Vision), Satyavādinī (Speaker of Truth), or Svapnavilokinī
                        (One Who Can See Dreams). </p>

                    <p>The other group of mantras in this chapter is concerned with obtaining
                        desired things, be it a lover, wealth, or even a kingdom. First is the
                        mantra of mighty Aditi, who, if propitiated in the prescribed manner, can
                        help one obtain a girl, riches, or power. Interestingly, we find a touch of
                        realism here, as the text tells us that one can obtain a kingdom only if one
                        is of royal descent; otherwise one will only obtain “great splendor.” The
                        deities invoked in this section range from yakṣa spirits, such as those in
                        the retinues of Jambhala or Vasudharā, to the mighty Mahālakṣmī or the two
                        deities just mentioned. </p>

                    <p>Chapter 3 is dedicated to the mantras of deities mainly invoked to increase
                        powers of eloquence, intelligence, memory, and learning. The first two
                        mantras invoke two manifestations of Mañjuśrī, Siddhaikavīra (even though,
                        as discussed above, the mantra invokes him by the name Arapacana) and Vākya.
                        The rituals of the latter can also bestow longevity and other boons. The
                        next few mantras are dedicated to Mañjuśrī’s consort, Mahāsarasvatī; their
                        benefits are the same as those mentioned above. Mahāsarasvatī, here
                        identified with Tārā, is visualized in the form of a young girl whose body
                        has the nature of great compassion and appears “in all the fresh beauty of
                        budding youth.” She can grant all siddhis. The chapter closes with the
                        mantras invoking, again, various forms of Mañjuśrī. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Chapter 4 contains only four mantras—all four used mainly for enthralling.
                        The first two are addressed to the mysterious deity Lavaṇāmbha (Salty
                        Water), whom the SEV associates with Avalokiteśvara. Invoked in the magic of
                        love and seduction, his name could be a metaphor for the thirst that his
                        rituals produce—thirst that can only be quenched by union with the desired
                        person. Next is the mantra of Kurukullā, the goddess with an arrow and bow
                        well known for her enthralling powers. The collection ends with an obscure
                        mantra whose grammar is ambiguous and open to different interpretations. The
                        content of the mantra also seems somewhat inconsistent with the ritual
                        subsequently described. The mantra seems to be addressed to a male deity who
                        governs the movements of the planets and is responsible for timely rain and
                        for bringing prosperity and happiness, and yet the ritual in which it is
                        employed is used to summon a desired woman or man. </p>

                    <p> As well as being divided into four chapters, the tantra can also be divided
                        into fifty-five sections, each containing one mantra. The content of each
                        section fits a particular pattern. Typically, a section starts with the
                        mantra and is followed by a statement of the mantra’s application and
                        effects, with a description of one or more ritual procedures required to
                        achieve a particular result. To reflect this structure and for easy
                        navigation and reference, we have numbered the mantras in our translation. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>There is no clear dividing line in the SEV between Buddhist and Hindu
                        pantheons. Some deities, such as Lakṣmī, would normally be regarded as
                        Hindu, while others, such as Sarasvatī or Kubera, have been shared to a
                        great extent by both religions. Many are exclusively Buddhist. Because of
                        the non-denominational spirit in this world of magic, it can sometimes be
                        difficult to determine whether a deity is actually meant to be Buddhist or
                        not, as for example in the case of Gaṇapati, whose form seems to be the
                        favorite for making ritual effigies in some rites, such as the rite for
                        stopping an onslaught by a hostile army. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>When translating the names of deities, particularly the names found in
                        mantras, it is not easy to decide whether a given appellation should be
                        interpreted as a proper name or an epithet. When faced with such
                        ambiguities, our translation tends to leave the borderline cases
                        untranslated, with the literal meaning given in the glossary. In some
                        mantras, the deity is addressed only by an epithet or epithets, and we can
                        do no more than guess who this could be. Only the context suggests Tārā,
                        Sarasvatī, etc. In cases where we find a group of names in grammatical
                        apposition, our uncertainty regarding which names in the group are proper
                        names and which are merely epithets is sometimes further confounded by
                        uncertainty about whether a particular mantra addresses one or more deities.
                        We were also faced with many difficulties due to the specific mantra jargon
                        itself, with its strong vernacular influence. Mantric syllables and words
                        that could not be identified have been printed in italics. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>As the ritual jargon of the SEV is often incompatible with modern English in
                        terms of semantics and usage, the reader will find that certain English
                        words in our translation have been used in somewhat unconventional ways. For
                        example, the direct object of the verb “to incant,” in our translation, can
                        be not only the mantra but also the object over which the mantra is to be
                        recited, such as a flower, a substance, or a diseased body part. This latter
                        usage was common in English until the mid-20th century, and despite a
                        precedent in modern English as well (the Harry Potter novels), to many
                        readers it may still seem “incorrect.” </p>

                        with vajra water after incanting it 108 times. Then the target will become
                        enthralled simply by drinking it. </p>
