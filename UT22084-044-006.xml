                    eight qualities. Starting with the excellent intention to become enlightened,
                    they include loving kindness, as well as realization of the perfection of
                    wisdom, which the Buddha explains in terms of reflection on the twelve links of

                    <p>In this sūtra, Maitreya asks the Buddha what qualities a bodhisattva needs in
                        order to be sure of completing the whole path to buddhahood. The Buddha
                        responds with a list of eight qualities that, while individually all
                        standard individual elements of the Mahāyāna path, as a set of eight appear
                        to be specific to this text. The Buddha briefly explains each quality and,
                        in his explanation of the last—the perfection of wisdom—outlines the
                        doctrine of the twelve links of dependent origination in both their
                        “forward” and “reverse” orders, corresponding to causation and cessation. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>It is difficult to determine the precise historical relationship of <title xml:lang="eng">The Question of Maitreya on the Eight Qualities</title>
                        with <title xml:lang="eng">The Question of Maitreya</title> (Toh 85), the longer
                        sūtra that immediately precedes it. Their themes are
                        obviously closely linked—in both, Maitreya questions the Buddha about the
                        bodhisattva’s qualities. However, their geographic setting differs—<title xml:lang="eng">The Question of Maitreya on the Eight Qualities</title>
                        takes place on Vulture Peak Mountain near Rājagṛha, like many other <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnakūṭa</title> sūtras, while <title xml:lang="eng">The Question of Maitreya</title> is delivered in a
                        relatively obscure location, Mount Śuśumāra in the country of the Bhargas. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>Both texts are included in the Denkarma (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">ldan
                            dkar ma</title>) inventory of early translations, dated to a year of the
                        dragon thought to be most likely 824 (but possibly 812), so they must have been
                        translated by that date. The translation of this one, the shorter sūtra, is
                        attributed to Jinamitra and Danaśila, and Yeshé Dé is said to have corrected
                        it using the revised terminology (<foreign type="term" xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">skad gsar</foreign>). Since <title xml:lang="eng">The Question of
                            Maitreya</title> appears to have needed no such revision, its first Tibetan translation
                        by Jinamitra and Surendrabodhi, under the editorial supervision of Yeshé Dé,
                        may have been slightly later. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>In the Degé Kangyur, the text has two different titles; the first, in the
                        initial line introducing it as the 42nd section of the Ratnakūṭa, calls it
                        “The Noble Elucidation of the Question of Maitreya on the Eight Qualities”
                            (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phags pa byams pas chos brgyad zhus pa lung
                            bstan pa</title>), while the second, immediately afterwards, simply “The
                        Noble Mahāyāna Sūtra of the Question of Maitreya” (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phags pa byams pas zhus pa zhes bya ba theg pa chen po’i mdo</title>),
                        which is the same as the title of the preceding text. The Sanskrit titles of
                        both sūtras, as transliterated in Tibetan in the Degé Kangyur, are also the
                        same: <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Maitreyaparipṛcchā</title>. In other
                        Kangyurs, a variety of similar titles are given, while in some—e.g. the
                        Narthang (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">snar thang</title>) and Stok Palace
                        Manuscript (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">stog pho brang bris ma</title>)
                        Kangyurs—the Sanskrit title includes mention of the eight qualities: <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Maitreyaparipṛcchādharmāṣṭa</title>. Whether the reference to the “eight qualities”  figured in the title of the Sanskrit
                        original or, if not, at what stage it was integrated into the title as a
                        convenient way of distinguishing this text from the preceding one, is
                        difficult to determine. In the Tibetan title, at least, inclusion of the eight
                        qualities was a feature in some Kangyurs and text catalogues early in the
                        imperial period, even if it was not universal. It is found (as <title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">’phags pa byams pas zhus pa’i chos brgyad pa</title>)
                        in the early 9th century Denkarma inventory mentioned above. </p>

                    <p>This sūtra and the preceding one in the <title xml:lang="Sa-Ltn">Ratnakūṭa</title> section, both often simply called
                            <title xml:lang="eng">The Question of Maitreya</title>, are not to be
                        confused with a third sūtra of the same name in the General Sūtra (<title xml:lang="Bo-Ltn">mdo sde</title>) section, Toh 149, a short work (also
                        set in Rajgṛha) in which Maitreya asks a quite different question. </p>

                    <p>Thus have I heard at one time. The Blessed One was staying in Rājagṛha on the
                        Vulture-peak, together with a great saṅgha of 1,250 monks and 10,000
                        bodhisattvas. The Blessed One, surrounded by a retinue of many hundreds
                        of thousands, surveyed those before him, and taught the Dharma. </p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>At that time, the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya was present among that very
                        retinue. He rose from his seat, draped his shawl over one shoulder, set his
                        right knee on the ground, and knelt down to pay homage with palms joined
                        before the Blessed One. He then said to the Blessed One, “Would the Blessed One please, if he has time, answer a certain question
                            that I would like to put to the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly
                            enlightened Buddha?” </p>
                    <p>The Blessed One <ref cRef="F.117.a"/> answered the bodhisattva mahāsattva
                        Maitreya, “Maitreya, you may put to the Tathāgata, the Arhat, the perfectly
                            enlightened Buddha, whatever question you wish. What I shall say in
                            response to your question will cause you to rejoice.”</p>
                    <milestone unit="chunk"/>
                    <p>So, since the Blessed One had given him the opportunity, the bodhisattva
                        mahāsattva Maitreya asked the Blessed One, “Blessed One, how many qualities does a bodhisattva mahāsattva need to
                            possess in order to become irreversibly set on supreme and perfect
                            enlightenment without regressing, without regressing in the slightest,
                            and to gain special attainments; to vanquish negative and hostile
                            influences; and, while engaging in the conduct of a bodhisattva, to

                            and therefore be indefatigable in saṃsāra; and, as well as having that
                            indefatigable mind, through the pristine awareness that does not rely on

                    <p>The Blessed One replied to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, “Very good, Maitreya. It is good that you have thought to ask the

                            retain in your mind what I shall explain to you.” </p>
                    <p>“Blessed One, please do so,” said the bodhisattva mahāsattva Maitreya, and listened as the Blessed One had
                        instructed him. </p>
